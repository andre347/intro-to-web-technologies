# **Introduction to Web Technologies**

Supporting material for introduction to web technologies. In order to create anything in Tableau, you need to understand the main web technologies. This is basically 'Level 0' for learning Web Data Connectors, working with the JavaScript API or building Extensions. All of these Tableau APIs assume you have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Without these three it's going to be very hard to develop anything.

The code in this repository is a reference point for those that want to follow along.
